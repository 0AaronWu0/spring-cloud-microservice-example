# Spring Boot Microservice Platform

This repository is an example cloud-native platform based on microservices built with Spring Boot. This example is meant to cover all aspects of building a cloud-native platform using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

## Technology Stack

Microservices provide teams the ability to choose their own technology stacks and expose APIs as REST resources. For this example I will use the following archtetype for microservices.

## Microzoning

One of the key tenets of this project is to demonstrate how to scale the development of a growing distributed services architecture. I'd like to introduce and test an idea of how to organically scale a distributed services architecture using a strategy I call *microzoning*.

Microzoning is an idea for a strategy of organically growing a distributed microservices architecture using models and metaphors into *urban planning*.

> Urban planning is a technical and political process concerned with the use of land and design of the urban environment, including air, water, and the infrastructure passing into and out of urban areas such as transportation and distribution networks. - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning)

In order to design a services architecture that relies on distributed processes and teams, a platform's design shifts from centralized master planning to decentralized local authorities. Microzoning is a body of policies that govern the behavior of services during their software lifecycle. The content of the policies are negotiated between scrum teams in order to build compliance between services.

The premise of this is that a technology organization will inevitably be required to adapt software systems to respond to opportunities in the marketplace.
